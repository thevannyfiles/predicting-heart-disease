# Predicting Heart Disease

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict heart disease using a dataset of patient information. The dataset includes various features such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol level, and others, which are used to determine the likelihood of heart disease.

## Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and treatment can significantly reduce the risk and improve patient outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning to predict heart disease based on various patient features, such as age, sex, cholesterol level, and more.

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project is the [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) from Kaggle. It contains 303 observations with 14 features related to patient health and medical history.
* **age:** Age of the patient
* **sex:** Sex of the patient
* **cp:** Chest pain type (4 values)
* **trestbps:** Resting blood pressure
* **chol:** Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
* **fbs:** Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
* **restecg:** Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2)
* **thalach:** Maximum heart rate achieved
* **exang:** Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
* **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* **slope:** The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* **ca:** Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
* **thal:** Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
* **target:** Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = yes; 0 = no)
